The Integrator is a modular automation and integration framework designed to streamline operational tasks. It features a dual-interface system (CLI and GUI) and includes an autonomous AI Architect capable of generating and deploying new integration tools on demand without manual coding.
Key Features
 * Modular Architecture: A plugin-based system where every tool is an independent module.
 * AI Architect: A built-in engine powered by OpenAI that generates valid Python integration scripts based on natural language descriptions.
 * Dual Interface:
   * Web Dashboard: A user-friendly GUI built with Streamlit for end-users.
   * CLI: A robust command-line interface for developers and server environments.
 * Centralized Logging: Automated event logging and error handling for all execution threads.
Prerequisites
 * Python 3.8 or higher.
 * An OpenAI API Key (required for the AI Architect feature).
Installation
 * Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
 * Open a terminal or command prompt in the project root directory.
 * Install the required dependencies:
<!-- end list -->
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
Before running the application, you must configure the system settings.
 * Navigate to the config directory.
 * Open settings.json.
 * Update the file with your OpenAI API Key:
<!-- end list -->
{
    "app_name": "The Integrator",
    "version": "4.0.0",
    "openai_api_key": "sk-proj-YOUR-KEY-HERE",
    "log_level": "INFO"
}

Usage
For End Users (GUI)
To launch the graphical dashboard:
 * Double-click the launcher.bat file in the root directory.
 * The interface will automatically open in your default web browser.
 * Select a tool from the sidebar to execute it.
For Developers (CLI)
To run the system in headless mode via the terminal:
python main.py

How to Use the AI Architect
The AI Architect allows you to create new tools without writing code.
 * Open the Dashboard.
 * Select AI Plugin Architect from the sidebar.
 * Tool Name: Enter a unique name for the new tool (e.g., currency_converter).
 * Description: Describe exactly what the tool should do (e.g., "Fetch the current exchange rate from USD to EUR").
 * Click Generate & Install Tool.
 * Once completed, click Reload System in the sidebar. The new tool will appear in the menu, ready for use.
Project Structure
 * core/ - System logic, plugin manager, and logger.
 * plugins/ - Directory containing all integration scripts.
 * config/ - JSON configuration files.
 * logs/ - Runtime logs generated by the system.
